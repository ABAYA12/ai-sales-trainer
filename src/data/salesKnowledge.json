    "discovery": [
      "Hi there! Thanks for taking the time. So what did you want to discuss?",
      "Good morning! I've got about 20 minutes. What questions do you have?",
      "Hi, I'm curious to learn more about what you're offering."
    ],
    "demo_followup": [
      "Hi! Yeah, I saw the demo last week. I have some questions.",
      "Thanks for following up. I've been discussing this with my team.",
      "Good timing - I was just about to reach out to you."
    ],
    "price_objection": [
      "Look, I'll be direct - your pricing is way too high. Our budget is about half of what you're asking.",
      "I've gotten quotes from competitors that are 30-40% less. Why should I pay more?",
      "I'm interested, but we don't have that kind of budget. What kind of discount can you offer?",
      "Before we go further, I need to know if you can be flexible on pricing."
    ],
    "negotiation": [
      "Okay, we're close to signing, but I need to work out some details. Your payment terms don't work for us.",
      "Before I sign off, my team has concerns. We need some features included that are currently add-ons.",
      "I'm ready to move forward, but my board wants a custom SLA with uptime guarantees.",
      "I've been authorized to proceed, but there are strings attached. Where can you be flexible?"
    ],
    "general": [
      "Hi there! Thanks for reaching out.",

  "responses": {
    "introduce_yourself": [
      "Nice introduction. So what exactly does your company do?",
      "Okay, I've heard of you. What makes your solution different?",
      "Sure. Tell me - what problem are you trying to solve for me?",
      "Got it. So why are you reaching out to me specifically?"
    ],
    "ask_about_needs": [
      "That's a good question. Our main challenge is [specific pain point]. How do you address that?",
      "Well, we're struggling with efficiency and our current process is manual. Can you help with that?",
      "Honestly, we're not even sure what we need. What do most companies in our situation typically look for?",
      "Our biggest issue is cost - everything is too expensive and we need better ROI."
    ],
    "explain_solution": [
      "Interesting. But how is that different from what we already have?",
      "I've heard this pitch before. What makes yours special?",
      "That sounds good in theory, but I need specifics. What results have you actually delivered?",
      "Okay, but what about integration with our existing systems? That's usually a nightmare."
    ],
    "discuss_features": [
      "Do you have [specific feature]? That's critical for us.",
      "What about reporting and analytics? We need detailed dashboards.",
      "Can it integrate with [popular tool]? We use that heavily.",
      "That's nice, but does it scale? We're growing fast."
    ],
    "pricing_pushback": [
      "That's way more than I expected. Can you break down what I'm paying for?",
      "Your competitor quoted me 30% less. Why is yours so expensive?",
      "I need at least 20% off to even consider this. What can you do?",
      "The price is a problem. What if we started with a smaller package?"
    ],
    "value_discussion": [
      "Show me the ROI. How quickly will this pay for itself?",
      "Value is great, but I need hard numbers. What savings are we talking about?",
      "I've been burned before by solutions that promised savings. Why is yours different?",
      "Okay, walk me through a real example of a customer who saw results."
    ],
    "competitor_comparison": [
      "I'm also talking to [competitor]. What's your advantage over them?",
      "Someone else quoted me less. Convince me why I should pay more.",
      "Why shouldn't I just go with the cheaper option?",
      "What do you have that they don't?"
    ],
    "timeline_concerns": [
      "How long does implementation take? I can't afford months of disruption.",
      "What's involved in getting this up and running?",
      "Do you handle the setup or is that on us?",
      "When can we realistically go live?"
    ],
    "security_compliance": [
      "What about security? We handle sensitive data.",
      "Are you SOC 2 compliant?",
      "How do you handle data privacy and GDPR?",
      "I need to see your security documentation before we go further."
    ],
    "support_training": [
      "What kind of support do you offer?",
      "Is training included or extra?",
      "What happens if something goes wrong?",
      "Do we get a dedicated account manager?"
    ],
    "objection_too_busy": [
      "I appreciate the call, but I'm slammed right now. Can you send me something?",
      "This isn't a priority for us at the moment.",
      "Maybe follow up next quarter when things slow down.",
      "I don't have time to evaluate new tools right now."
    ],
    "objection_happy_current": [
      "We already have a solution and it works fine.",
      "Why would we switch? That's a lot of effort.",
      "Our current vendor gives us good service.",
      "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
    ],
    "objection_need_approval": [
      "I'll need to run this by my boss.",
      "This requires board approval, which takes time.",
      "Let me discuss with my team and get back to you.",
      "I can't make this decision alone."
    ],
    "positive_interest": [
      "This actually sounds promising. What are the next steps?",
      "I like what I'm hearing. How do we move forward?",
      "Okay, you've got my attention. What do you need from me?",
      "Let's explore this further. Can you send me a proposal?"
    ],
    "trial_request": [
      "Can we do a trial first?",
      "I need to test this with my team before committing.",
      "What if it doesn't work for us? Do you have a money-back guarantee?",
      "Let me see it in action before I spend money on it."
    ],
    "closing_signals": [
      "Alright, you've convinced me. Let's talk contract terms.",
      "I'm ready to move forward. What's the process?",
      "Okay, I want to do this. Send me the paperwork.",
      "This makes sense. Let's get started."
    ],
    "negotiation_payment_terms": [
      "We need quarterly payments, not annual upfront.",
      "Can you do monthly billing for the first year?",
      "Net-60 payment terms are required by our finance department.",
      "I can't do full payment upfront for an unproven vendor."
    ],
    "negotiation_features": [
      "I need these premium features included at no extra cost.",
      "You're listing things as add-ons that should be standard.",
      "For this price, I expect everything included.",
      "Your competitor includes more features in their base package."
    ],
    "negotiation_timeline": [
      "Your timeline is too aggressive. We need to push this to next quarter.",
      "Can we phase the rollout instead of doing everything at once?",
      "My team doesn't have bandwidth for a quick implementation.",
      "If we're delaying, I expect you to hold this pricing."
    ],
    "negotiation_sla": [
      "I need 99.99% uptime guaranteed, not 99.9%.",
      "What happens if you miss your SLA targets? I want financial penalties.",
      "We need 1-hour response time for critical issues.",
      "Show me your actual uptime stats, not just promises."
    ],
    "final_objection": [
      "I still have concerns about [specific issue]. Address that and we're good.",
      "Almost there, but I need one more concession to get this approved.",
      "My team is skeptical. Give me ammunition to sell this internally.",
      "I want to do this, but I need to see it's the right decision."
