# PitchPilot - Judge's One-Pager

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM
**Sales reps have no safe place to practice.** New SDRs take 3-6 months to ramp ($30K-60K lost productivity). Traditional solutions fail: manager role-plays are rare, peer practice isn't realistic, and real calls are too expensive to mess up.

## 💡 THE SOLUTION
**AI-powered flight simulator for sales calls.** Practice with brutally realistic AI customers, get instant performance scores, improve before the stakes are real.

## 🏆 WHY WE WIN

### 2. Live AI Coaching (Innovation Edge)
- ✅ Success: "Great job making it about the customer!"
- ⚠️ Warning: "Discussing price too early! Build value first"
